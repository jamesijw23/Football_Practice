    "The purpose of this notebook is to curate a data set that determines the outcome of a game and relevant statistics that I believe will predict the outcome of the game. There are 1791 unique games from 2009 to 2015 that are within the main data set. The following variables were created:\n",
    "* Average Yard Gained by Passing \n",
    "* Average Yard Gained by Rushing \n",
    "* Total Yards Allowed by Defense Passing\n",
    "* TotalYards Allowed by Defense Rushing\n",
    "* Turnovers by Offense \n",
    "* Turnovers caused by Defense\n",
    "* Scores by Offense \n",
    "* Scores by Denfense\n",
    "\n",
    "A function was created to determine these statistics for each of the games. Though there are many other statistics that could have been created, this is a first attempt to understand the dynamics of a good team."
